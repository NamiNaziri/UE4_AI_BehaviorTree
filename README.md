# UE4_AI_BehaviorTree
Final project of my Game AI course


# Introduction
For my final project I tried to use the knowledge I gained during the course and create a boss AI using behavior tree in Unreal Engine 4. I went with Khaimera as the player character and Riktor as the boss. These characters are from paragon pack which can be found in the Unreal Engine marketplace. 

# Behavior Tree

Each behavior tree is consist of several selectors, sequences, decorators, services and of course lots of tasks.
The AI has diffrent sequences. these sequences are dependent on player's location and wheder he is dead or not. 

## Attacking Sequence

Attack sequence is a simple sequence which first uses the Blackboard Based Condition decorator to check if the boss is close enough to attack the player. If he is close enough, he will attack. After each attack he has cooldown of 0.2 second. The attacking state uses combo system. This means boss can attack the player by performing combo. CooldownBB_Based is the node which inherits from the cooldown decorator of the engine. The responsibility of this decorator is that when the boss performed his combo he gets a cooldown of 4 second. During this 4 seconds he will strafe randomely around the player (Using the random strafe sequence)

## Random Strafe Sequence

In this sequence we can still see the same pattern of using Blackboard Based Condition decorator to determine whether the character is close enough or not. this sequence will run if the boss is in his cooldown mode for too much attacking. As can be seen there is a service to find a random location arount a specefic target. the tasks are self explanatory. First the strafe speed will be set, then the strafe will be enabled, After that the boss will focus on the target(player) and finally move to the location which is determind using the mentioned service.

## Attack Mode Sequence

This a sequence with similar functionality of random strafe. the only diffrence is the distance to the player.

## Hook Attack

Hook is one of the abilities of the Riktor. The way I used this ability was when the character is running away from the boss, he uses his hook to bring the player close to him. There is a 2 second stun after the hook attack. The player can dodge the chain by jumping at the right moment.

#Rush To Target

This sequence has the similar functionality to attack mode and random strafe. So, when the character scape the hook attack and run away, the boss increase his speed and follow him to reach the player.

## Wander

When the boss kills the player, he starts wandering in the world.

## death

When the boss dies, die animation will be played and the focus on player will get disabled.


## FindRandomLocationAroundTarget

This is a service which is frequently used to find a random location around a specific target. this target can be an acotr such as the player or even the boss himself.

Input of this service are the target which take an actor reference and TargetDestination is where the location will be save(one of the variables in the blackboard). And finally the radius. The random location is a location which is located on a circle around the specified target with specified radius.
